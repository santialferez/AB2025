# Bioestatistical Learning (AB2025)

Course from Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC) on machine learning and deep learning applied to biostatistics.

## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning, with a special focus on their application in the field of biostatistics. Through theoretical and practical sessions, students will learn to implement and train deep learning models using PyTorch, from basic neural networks to advanced architectures like Transformers.
